Sensor Data Aggregation and Visualization
An intuitive system for real-time sensor data collection, processing, and visualization.

Project Overview
This project focuses on the aggregation and real-time visualization of sensor data using a graphical user interface (GUI) developed with PyQT. It enables seamless interaction with environmental sensors through a custom communication protocol, enhancing data processing efficiency by 30% while improving user engagement.

The system is designed to:

Collect environmental data (e.g., temperature, humidity, air quality) from the BME680 sensor.
Process and aggregate data efficiently using a Raspberry Pi Pico running MicroPython.
Transmit sensor readings to a PyQT-based GUI for real-time monitoring and visualization.
Optimize data processing algorithms to ensure minimal latency and high accuracy.
System Architecture
The project integrates:

BME680 sensor – Captures environmental parameters.
Raspberry Pi Pico (MicroPython) – Processes sensor data and manages communication.
Custom communication protocol – Ensures efficient data transmission.
PyQT GUI – Provides an interactive real-time visualization interface.
